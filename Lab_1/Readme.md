# Lab 1 – Introduction to Python and NumPy

## Objective
Learn Python fundamentals and explore array operations using NumPy and basic data visualization with Matplotlib.

## Tasks
1. Practice basic Python constructs: loops, conditions, and functions.  
2. Work with data structures: lists and dictionaries for computation.  
3. Perform essential NumPy operations:
   - Array creation, reshaping, slicing  
   - Element-wise arithmetic and aggregation  
   - Logical indexing and replacement  
4. Visualize data using Matplotlib (line and bar charts).

## Key Concepts
- Python syntax & control structures  
- Dictionary and list manipulation  
- NumPy arrays and vectorized operations  
- Basic data visualization  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Output
- Console outputs for Python and NumPy tasks  
- Matrix operations and computed summaries  
- Line and bar plots comparing data
