# Lab 8 – Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Objective
Implement PCA from scratch and apply it for dimensionality reduction.

## Tasks
1. Compute covariance matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors.  
2. Project data to reduced dimensions.  
3. Plot reconstruction loss vs number of components.  
4. Compare classification performance (with vs without PCA).  

## Key Concepts
- Covariance and Eigen decomposition  
- Explained Variance  
- Reconstruction Loss  
- Dimensionality Reduction  

## Tools Used
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## Output
- Reconstruction loss plot  
- Explained variance curve  
- Classification performance table
