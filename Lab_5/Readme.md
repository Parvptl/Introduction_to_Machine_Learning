# Lab 5 – Logistic Regression from Scratch & Naive Bayes Classification

## Objective
Implement Logistic Regression manually and compare with Gaussian Naive Bayes.

## Tasks
1. Implement Logistic Regression using NumPy (from scratch).  
2. Train on Heart Disease dataset, plot cost convergence.  
3. Train GaussianNB using scikit-learn and evaluate performance.  
4. Compare both models’ accuracy and explain Naive Bayes assumptions.  

## Key Concepts
- Logistic Regression math & gradient descent  
- L2 Regularization  
- Naive Bayes independence assumption  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## Tools Used
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## Output
- Convergence plot  
- Confusion matrices  
- Accuracy comparison and explanation
