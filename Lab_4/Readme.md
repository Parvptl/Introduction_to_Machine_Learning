# Lab 4 – Cross-Validation, Ridge Regression and Nonlinear Regression

## Objective
Apply Ridge and Polynomial Regression models and visualize their performance.

## Tasks
1. Generate nonlinear data (sin(x) + noise).  
2. Fit Ridge regression (linear, poly-3, poly-30).  
3. Visualize model fits and overfitting behavior.  
4. Perform multivariate regression with cross-validation.  

## Key Concepts
- Ridge Regularization  
- Polynomial Features  
- Cross-Validation (CV)  
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff  

## Tools Used
- NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## Output
- Regression plots for degrees 3 and 30  
- Cross-validation score summary  
- Discussion on overfitting/underfitting
