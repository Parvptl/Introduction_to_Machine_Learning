# Lab 10 – Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

## Objective
Model weather transitions using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with discrete states and observations.

## Tasks
1. Define transition, emission, and initial probability matrices.  
2. Construct an HMM using `hmmlearn`.  
3. Compute sequence log-likelihood (Forward algorithm).  
4. Decode most probable hidden states (Viterbi).  
5. Simulate weather sequences.  
6. Compare normal vs stable weather models.  

## Key Concepts
- Markov property & hidden states  
- Forward and Viterbi algorithms  
- Log-likelihood interpretation  
- HMM simulation  

## Tools Used
- hmmlearn  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Output
- State transition & emission matrices  
- Log-likelihoods for observed sequences  
- Simulation plots & model comparison
